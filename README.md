  ## Description 
A burger logger app built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Created following the MVC design pattern, and deployed to Heroku. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data through the app, and Handlebars generates the HTML and Bootstrap front-end.

The user can enter a the names of burgers they would like to eat, and this is displayed on the left side of the page under "Menu". The user can then hit the "Devour" button, and the burger will appear under "Devoured" on the right side of the page. The app stores every burger, both newly created or already devoured, in a database stored on JawsDB.
